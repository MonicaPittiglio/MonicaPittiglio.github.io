[View my final reasearch project at] (https://monicapittiglio.github.io/COVID-19/)

My name is Monica Pittiglio, and I am a professional pharmacy student at the Universtiy of Colorado's Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. I plan to use my degree to become a research scientist specializing in drug research and development. I have a bit of experinece already after working as a research assistant for two different professors at Ferris State University. I am also heavily involved in drug policy activism, and hope to use my professional voice to fight for price decreases for some medications.

During my free time, I travel the world with my best friend thanks to benefits from my airline job. I am both respectful of and fascinated by cultures outside of my own. I've been to 22 countries so far. I hope to learn Thai in the near future so that I can one day buy myself a home in Thailand.
